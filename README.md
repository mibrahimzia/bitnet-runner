# Quick Start

1. **Install the App**  
   Download and install BitNet Runner on Windows. It will set up a `.bitnet-runner` folder under your user directory.
   from releases: https://github.com/mibrahimzia/bitnet-runner/releases

2. **Add a Model**  
   Place any BitNet model in `.gguf` format inside the `models` folder located at:  
   ```
   C:\Users\<username>\.bitnet-runner\models\
   ```
   Restart the app if it is already running so the model appears in the dropdown menu.

3. **Start Chatting Offline**  
   Launch the app, select your model, and begin chatting through the built‑in interface.

👉 Example model to try: [BitNet b1.58 2B 4T GGUF](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/bitnet-b1.58-2B-4T-gguf)

# Usage Instructions

## 1. Install the Desktop App
Download and install the BitNet Runner desktop app as you would any other application on Windows.  
After installation, the app will create a folder named:

```
C:\Users\<username>\.bitnet-runner\
```

This folder contains several subfolders used by the app.

---

## 2. Add Models
Inside the `.bitnet-runner` directory, you will find a `models` folder:

```
C:\Users\<username>\.bitnet-runner\models\
```

Place your BitNet models here in **`.gguf` format**.  
If the app is already running, close and restart it so the new model is detected and shown in the dropdown menu.

## 3. Example Model
To get started, you can download the official BitNet model from Hugging Face:

👉 [BitNet b1.58 2B 4T GGUF](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/bitnet-b1.58-2B-4T-gguf)

### How to download from Hugging Face
1. Visit the model page.  
2. Click on the **Files and versions** tab.  
3. Select the `.gguf` file you want.  
4. Download it and place it in the `models` folder as described above.

## 4. About the Project
BitNet Runner is designed to make working with BitNet models simple and stress‑free.  
Instead of manually handling dependencies and complex setups, you can run models offline with a clean chat interface.  

BitNet itself is an experimental architecture with potential for efficient inference. While still early in development, it demonstrates promising directions for lightweight AI models.
